# What is UML?
- General-purpose visual modeling language
- Often used in software development/design, but not limited to it.
- What is happening in the software?
- Developed sepcifily for Object Oriented Programming
- Not a description of a detailed development process. 
- A way to describe the code.


## Is UML a standard
- UML does not define a standard
- It is intended to be a iterative development process
- Can be used for GUI, VLSI, Machine learning design
- Can be used to combine desgin across projects or programming languages.
	- Machine learning in python, data collection in C++ and GUI in C#. All of these projects/services can be united with an UML diagram. 


## UML history
- 1996: OMG issued a request for proposals
- 2005: UML 2.0
- UML combines the commonly accepted concepts from man object-oriented methods. 
- UML is intended to model most application domains. 

## UML Benefits
- Abstraction
- Maintainace 
- Simplify complex descisions
- Connect multiple programming languages and projects. 

## Types of UML
- 14 types of UML

- Structure
	- **Class**
	- Component
	- Deployment
	- Object
	- Package
	- Profile
	- Composite structure
- Behavioral
	- **Use case**
	- **Activity**
	- State machine
	- **Sequence**
	- Interaction
	- Timing
Bold types will be covered in this class.

## Complexity of UML 
- Diagrams can be subjective. There is no single-right way to use UML 
- There are overlapping features with different types of diagrams. 
- UML has a wide use case. Both for technical and non-technical use-cases.
