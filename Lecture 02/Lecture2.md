# Inheritance
- Inheritance is when a class inherits data and methods from another class. 
- A child class inherits from a parent class.
-  Modular code
    - Classes can reuse and share data and methods.
    - Blocks of code are contained within corresponding classes. 
-  Defines standard interfaces for objects.
    - A parent class can define a minimum requirement for subclasses.
- Inheritance enables polymorphism.
    - Classes can inherit from multiple parent classes.

# What is modular ?
- Blocks of code you can reuse multiple places. 
- Modular code can be abstract and generalized.
- Modular code makes a codebase easier to maintain.

# What does refactor mean?
- Refactoring means rebuilding/restructuring an existing codebase without changing the software's function. 
- Refactoring can be applied when exsisting code needs to meet new requirements. 
	- Examples of new requirements can be:
		- New versions of dependencies
		- Readability
		- Efficiency
- Refactoring can be a preventive measure to reduce complexity and ease maintainability.

# What is clean code?
- Code that is easy to read. 
- Functions, methods and variables have descriptive names that correspond with their intended purpose. 
- Logical statments are as simplified as possible. 
- Comments
	- Specifying parameters for methods and functions. Required and optional.
	- Return types
	- Explaination on what function, method, class or variable does

# Abstraction
- Complex code is hidden behind an simple interface
- Abstraction is often generalized, which means it can more easily be reused.

# Open source
- Projects where its content is "free"
- Free as in open, available and without cost.
